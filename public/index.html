        <title>Description</title>
        <p>For the past 4 years I've beein working as a Developer Support Specialist and, while I have learned a lot during this time the importance of customer service and how to talki
          with customes (in this case, developer), I've lost coding skills. In this job, although I need to do small programs to test and verify issues, it doesn't comper to do real coding.
          I recently had an interview and I knew I was a bit rusty and after starting to prepare for the interview, I was surprised that, not only was I extremly rusty on coding, but also
          on computer science topics. It was shocking, even my skills to think and use logic to resolve problems was deteriorated. 
          
          I've been studying for the past few months and while I'm able to resolve some problems now (I've been re-gaining some of the losts skills ðŸ˜€ ) I think I still need a lot of practice
          to do. For this reason, I decided to create this website. 

          My intention is to create a visual representation of computer science topics. For this, I will be using P5.js 

          I know, the website looks terrible right now. But this is something I will improve little by little and hopefully, I will increase my skills as well as to learn some new things. 

          I plan to provide a brief description of each topic, a visual representation and (hopefully) visual representation of the related operations.

          These are the topics I'm planning to cover:
